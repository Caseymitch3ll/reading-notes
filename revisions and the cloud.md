 - Allows you to share, compare, and revisit old versions of files using a VCS- Version control system
 - *local version control*: One database on your hard drive that stores file changes- 
 - *centralised version control*: single server storing all changes accessable to others
 - *distributed version control*: Allows repositories to be mirrored for a back up  or to share with others
 - Git, considered a DCVS, creats snapshots of all commited changes. 
 - *commited*: Data is securely stored in local database 
 - *modified*: Changes have been made to the file, but has not been Commited to the data base.
